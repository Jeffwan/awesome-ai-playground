# Awesome AI Playground

Welcome to the AI Playground! This repository includes demos of Stable Fussion and ChatGPT models, as well as tools to build an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) or a container to set up an environment for easy experimentation with the models.

## Quick start

- AMI
- Container

## Getting Started

To get started with the AI Playground, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Choose the tool you want to use (AMI or container) and follow the instructions in the corresponding README file to build the environment.
- Once you have the environment set up, you can use the Stable Fussion and ChatGPT demos to experiment with the models.

## Tools

### AMI Builder
The AMI tool allows you to build an Amazon Machine Image that includes all the necessary dependencies and configurations to run the Stable Diffussion and ChatGPT like open source models. This makes it easy to spin up instances on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and start experimenting with the models.

### Container
The container tool allows you to build a Docker container that includes all the necessary dependencies and configurations to run the Stable Diffussion and ChatGPT models. This makes it easy to run the models locally or in a cloud environment that supports Docker.
